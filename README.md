# HearRateMonitor


Nowadays, it is already possible to measure the pulse rate
through portable devices available on the market with
that specific goal. These use very small optoelectronic sensors.
that detect the variation of the pulse.

In this project, I had the opportunity to design and implement
a system for measuring the heartbeat of an individual,
through the development of an electronic circuit for signal conditioning of an
optoelectronic sensor and its connection to
a data acquisition and virtual instrumentation system.
Finally, It was developed a virtual instrument that reads
reliable measurement and evaluates the individual's condition.

In the wiki it will be possible to check the report written about this project.
