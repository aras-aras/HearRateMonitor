# HearRateMonitor


This project provided me with the opportunity to design and implement a system for measuring an individual's heartbeat. This involved developing an electronic circuit to condition the signal of an optoelectronic sensor and connecting it to a data acquisition and virtual instrumentation system. Ultimately, a virtual instrument was developed to accurately measure and evaluate the individual's condition. 
A comprehensive report about this project is available in the wiki for further reference.
